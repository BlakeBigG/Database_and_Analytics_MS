    "\n",
    "A key is a subset of one or more columns (attributes) which uniquely identifies rows in the table. Formally, a set of columns is a key for a relation if:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. No two distinct rows can have same values in all key columns, and\n",
    "2. This is not true for any subset of the key (i.e., minimal set of attributes)\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g., `aisle_id` is key for the aisles table as it identifies each row of this aisles table. Similarity (order_id, product_id) is a key as this pair of columns uniquely identifies each row of the order_product table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Super key\n",
    "\n",
    "Like a key, a super key also uniquely identifies rows in the table, but it may not consist of minimal set of attributes (i.e. condition [2] may not be satisfied). So we can say each key is a super key, but each super key is not a key. E.g., in the orders table (order_id, user_id, eval_set) is a super key. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Candidate Key\n",
    "\n",
    "A table can have one or more keys, and each of them is called a candidate key. E.g., In the orders table, both order_id and order_number are candidate keys as each of them uniquely identifies each row of the table. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Primary Key (PK)\n",
    "A candidate key that is chosen as the primary index for the table. A primary key is a candidate key, but a candidate key may not be a primary key. E.g., order_id, department_id, and product_id are examples of primary keys in the above dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Foreign Key (FK)\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key establishes relationship (connection) between two tables. A foreign key is a set of one or more columns in a table that refers to the candidate key (usually primary key) in another table. A foreign key is used to link rows in a Table B back to a single \"parent\" row of data in Table A. E.g., A department can have 1 or more products. _products_ belong to _departments_ by the way of the product's Foreign Key reference (`department_id`) to the department Primary Key (`customer_id`).\n",

    "## B. Functional Dependency (FD) \n",
    "\n",
    "A functional dependency is a constraint between two sets of attributes in a relation. \n",
    "In other words, functional dependency is a constraint that describes the relationship between fields (i.e columns) in a record (i.e., row).\n",
    "The most common functional dependency is that a candidate key determines the non-key (non-prime) attributes of the record's fields. Functional dependency is denoted as follows. \n",
    "\n",
    "Field Y is a functional dependency of X:\n",
    "$\n",
    "X \\rightarrow Y\n",
    "$\n",

    "In other words, a dependency FD: $X \\rightarrow Y$ means that the values of Y are determined by the values of X. Two tuples sharing the same values of X will necessarily have the same values of Y.\n",
